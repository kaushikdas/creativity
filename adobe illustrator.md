### Isolation Mode

If an object (or a _group_ of objects) is selected using the `Section Tool` and then
if the object is _double clicked_ it goes to **isolation mode** where we can just 
work on the selected object (or the group) in isolation&mdash;rest of the page gets
deselected.

To get out of this isolation mode, select _Exit isolation mode_ or click on the leftmost
_layer_ on the tool bar that appears below the filename of the canvas.
